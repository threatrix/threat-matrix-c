======================================================================

DoxyGate is a cross-platform GUI frontend for Doxygen 
(http://www.doxygen.org), a famous documentation generator. DoxyGate
provides easy-to-use modern interface and allows quickly and simply

Official web site of the project:

LICENSING

DoxyGate is free software and is distributed according to GPL license.



INSTALLING DoxyGate

On Windows, if you want to install the precompiled binary
packages, simply launch the package and follow the instructions in the
installation wizard.

On Linux, you have to install from a source package (a .tar.gz, .tar.bz2, or .zip file).
There are following installation steps:

1. Make sure that you have Qt 4.4.x installed on your system.
(note: DoxyGate could be also built with high probability with Qt 4.3.x,
althought there are no warranties)

2. Make sure that you have C++ compiler installed which fits Qt 4.4.x
requirements.

3. Unpack the archive into a directory.

4. Go into this directory and type 'qmake'. This should call QMake 
tool which creates Makefiles.

5. Depending on which compiler do you use, type 'make' (for GCC),
or 'nmake' (for MSVC), or 'mingw-make' (for minGW). Build process should
be started.

6. After successful build, type 'make install'. This will copy DoxyGate
binaries to your system. By default, it is /usr/bin directory 
(on Linux), but you can change it by editing 'doxygate.pro' file
('target.path' entry). Please use qmake again before doing installation
in order to regenerate make files if you have changed 'doxygate.pro'.

NOTE: Probably you should have administrative access to the system in order to
fulfill the installation.
